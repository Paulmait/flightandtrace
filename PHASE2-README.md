# Phase 2 - Tiers, Billing, and Gating Implementation Complete üöÄ

## Overview

Phase 2 of FlightTrace implements a complete subscription billing system with Stripe integration, tier-based feature gating, and competitive pricing aligned with industry leaders like Flightradar24 and FlightAware.

## ‚úÖ Phase 2 Deliverables

### 1. Stripe Products & Pricing Configuration

**Subscription Tiers Implemented:**

- **Free**: 5-min delay, 7-day history, 2 alerts, ads enabled
- **Premium ($7.99/mo)**: Real-time, 90-day history, 10 alerts, weather overlay, API 1k/day, ad-free, **7-day trial**
- **Pro ($24.99/mo)**: 365-day history, unlimited alerts, CSV/GeoJSON export, API 10k/day, **7-day trial**  
- **Business ($99.99/mo)**: 3-year history, team seats, SSO, SLA, unlimited API

**Key Features:**
- Monthly and yearly billing options with savings
- 7-day free trials for Premium and Pro tiers
- Competitive pricing analysis with footnoted sources
- Environment-based Stripe price ID configuration

### 2. Server-Side Subscription Middleware

**Comprehensive Middleware System:**
```typescript
// Feature gating by subscription tier
app.use('/api/flights', middleware.requireTier(SubscriptionTier.PREMIUM));

// API rate limiting
app.use('/api/', middleware.enforceApiLimits);

// Data delay enforcement
app.use('/api/flights', middleware.addDataDelay);

// Historical data filtering
app.use('/api/history', middleware.filterHistoricalData);
```

**Security Features:**
- JWT-based authentication
- Redis-backed session management
- Rate limiting with jitter and exponential backoff
- Feature-based access control
- Trial expiration enforcement

### 3. Client-Side Feature Flag System

**React Hooks & Context:**
```javascript
// Feature gate hook
const { checkFeature } = useFeatureGate();
const weatherResult = checkFeature('weatherOverlay');

// Subscription context
const { subscription, isTrialing, getTrialDaysRemaining } = useSubscription();
```

**Components:**
- `<FeatureGate>` - Conditional rendering with upgrade prompts
- `<TrialBanner>` - FR24-style urgency messaging
- HOC support for feature wrapping

### 4. Trial Banner (FR24-Style Behavior)

**Smart Trial Management:**
- Days remaining countdown with urgency at 3 days
- Dynamic messaging based on trial status
- Dismissible for free users (persistent storage)
- Animated progress bar for urgency
- Responsive design with mobile optimization

**Behavioral Features:**
- Auto-urgency activation at 3 days remaining  
- Pulse animations for urgent states
- Feature highlights for free tier conversion
- Non-dismissible when trial nearly expired

### 5. Pricing Page with Sources & Footnotes

**Professional Pricing Display:**
- Competitive comparison table with Flightradar24 and FlightAware
- Detailed footnotes explaining feature limitations
- Source verification and update timestamps
- "from $X (see site)" for unverified competitor pricing
- Responsive card layout with popular tier highlighting

**Transparency Features:**
- 11 detailed footnotes covering all plan limitations
- Source citations with last updated dates
- Monthly review schedule commitment
- Regional pricing disclaimers

### 6. Billing & Account Management UI

**Complete Dashboard:**
- Current subscription status with visual indicators
- Usage statistics with progress bars
- Feature availability matrix
- Upgrade/downgrade flows
- Cancellation with end-of-period vs immediate options
- Billing history and invoice downloads

### 7. API Usage Tracking & Limits

**Real-Time Enforcement:**
- Redis-based daily usage tracking
- Per-minute rate limiting
- Automatic limit resets at UTC midnight
- Usage analytics and reporting
- Overage notifications

**Fair Usage Implementation:**
- Exponential backoff for API failures
- Jitter in retry timing to prevent thundering herd
- Graceful degradation for limit exceeded scenarios

### Key Design Patterns

**Server-Side:**
- Middleware-based feature gating
- Service layer for business logic separation
- Redis caching for performance
- Webhook-based Stripe integration

**Client-Side:**
- Context providers for subscription state
- Custom hooks for feature checking
- Component composition for feature gates
- Progressive enhancement for premium features

## üí∞ Competitive Positioning

### Pricing Comparison (Sept 2025)
