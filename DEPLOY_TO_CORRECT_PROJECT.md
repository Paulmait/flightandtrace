# 🚨 CRITICAL: You Have 2 Projects - Wrong One Being Used!

## THE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:

You have **TWO Vercel projects**:

1. **`flighttrace`** (flightandtrace.com) - ✅ HAS YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
2. **`flight-tracker-project`** (flight-tracker-project.vercel.app) - ❌ NO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

We've been deploying to the WRONG one!

## 🔧 FIX THIS NOW - 3 Options:

### Option 1: Deploy Manually to Correct Project (EASIEST)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click on `flighttrace`** (the one with flightandtrace.com)
3. **Go to "Settings" → "Git"**
4. Make sure it's connected to: `Paulmait/flightandtrace`
5. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
6. **Click "Create Deployment"** or **"Redeploy"**
7. Deploy from `master` branch

Your app will then be live at: **https://flightandtrace.com** with all environment variables working!

### Option 2: Copy Environment Variables to Other Project

If you want to use `flight-tracker-project` instead:

1. Go to `flighttrace` project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Copy each variable value
3. Go to `flight-tracker-project` → Settings → Environment Variables  
4. Add all the same variables
5. Redeploy

### Option 3: Delete Wrong Project and Use Only One

1. Keep `flighttrace` (has custom domain + env vars)
2. Delete `flight-tracker-project` (no env vars, not needed)
3. Always deploy to `flighttrace`

## 📋 Quick Check - Which Project Has What:

### `flighttrace` (flightandtrace.com)
- ✅ Custom domain
- ✅ All environment variables
- ✅ Connected to GitHub
- ✅ This is the one you SHOULD use

### `flight-tracker-project` 
- ❌ No custom domain
- ❌ No environment variables
- ❌ Manual deployments only
- ❌ Can be deleted

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION:

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/paul-maitlands-projects-ba42f0ad/flighttrace
2. **Click**: Deployments tab
3. **Click**: "Redeploy" on latest
4. **Wait**: 2 minutes
5. **Visit**: https://flightandtrace.com

Your flights should now work because this project HAS the environment variables!

## 🧪 Test URLs After Correct Deployment:

```bash
# Test your custom domain
curl https://flightandtrace.com/api/debug

# Should show "configured": 14+ (not 0)

# Test flights
curl https://flightandtrace.com/api/flights

# Should return actual flight data
```

## ⚠️ Going Forward:

- **ALWAYS deploy to `flighttrace`** (not flight-tracker-project)
- Your live site is: **flightandtrace.com**
- Delete the other project to avoid confusion

---

**The solution is simple: You've been deploying to the wrong Vercel project! Use `flighttrace` which has your environment variables.**
