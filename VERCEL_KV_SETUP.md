# Vercel KV Setup Guide - Enable Ultra-Fast Caching

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable KV Storage in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `flighttrace` or `flight-tracker-project`
3. Navigate to the **Storage** tab
4. Click **Create Database**
5. Select **KV Storage**
6. Choose:
   - Name: `flight-cache`
   - Region: Select closest to your users (or `iad1` for US East)
7. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Connect KV to Your Project

1. After creating KV storage, click **Connect Project**
2. Select your flight tracker project
3. Choose all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Click **Connect**

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Vercel automatically adds these environment variables:
- `KV_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_URL` 
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`

**No manual configuration needed!**

### Step 4: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the three dots on latest deployment
3. Select **Redeploy**
4. Wait 1-2 minutes

## ✅ Verify It's Working

Visit your site and check the browser console Network tab:
- Look for `/api/flights` responses
- Check the response headers for `cached: true`
- Second visits to same region should load in <100ms

## 📊 What You'll See

### Before KV (Current):
- Initial load: 5-10 seconds
- Region switch: 3-5 seconds
- Map pan/zoom: 2-3 seconds

### After KV (With Caching):
- Initial load: 1-2 seconds
- Region switch: <500ms (from cache)
- Map pan/zoom: <200ms (from cache)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **First Request**: Fetches from OpenSky, caches for 60 seconds
2. **Subsequent Requests**: Serves from cache (instant)
3. **Cache Expiry**: After 60 seconds, fetches fresh data
4. **Fallback**: If API fails, uses stale cache or demo data

## 💰 Pricing

- **Free Tier**: 
  - 3,000 requests/day
  - 256MB storage
  - Perfect for your current traffic

- **Pro Tier** ($20/month if needed):
  - 100,000 requests/day
  - 1GB storage

## 🔍 Monitor Performance

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → **KV Storage**
2. View metrics:
   - Cache hit rate
   - Request count
   - Storage usage
   - Response times

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Cache not working?
1. Check environment variables are set
2. Redeploy the project
3. Check Vercel logs for errors

### Still slow?
- The first request to each region will be slow (cache miss)
- Subsequent requests should be instant
- Cache expires after 60 seconds

## 📈 Expected Results

- **Cache Hit Rate**: 70-80%
- **Average Response Time**: <200ms
- **API Calls Reduced**: 60-70%
- **User Experience**: Near-instant region switching

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. API responses include `"cached": true`
2. Response times show `"responseTime": <100`
3. Region switching feels instant
4. No lag when returning to previously viewed regions

**That's it!** Your flight tracker now has enterprise-grade caching at zero cost (free tier)! 🚀
